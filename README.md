# VOLTHA System Tests

Automated test-suites to validate the stability/functionality of VOLTHA. Tests
that reside in here should be written in Robot Framework and Python.

Intended use includes:

* Functional testing
* Integration and Acceptance testing
* Sanity and Regression testing
* Scale Testing using BBSIM
* Failure scenario testing

## Prerequisites

* Python [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

* `voltctl` - a command line tool to access VOLTHA. Reference -
  [voltctl](https://github.com/opencord/voltctl)

* `kubectl` - a command line tool to access your Kubernetes Clusers. Reference
  - [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/)

* `voltctl` and `kubectl` must be properly configured on your system
  prior to any test executions.  The `kind-voltha` environment will install
  and configure these tools for you; see below.

Directory is structured as follows:

```
├── tests
  └── sanity/           // basic tests that should always pass. Will be used as gating-patchsets
  └── functional/       // feature/functionality tests that should be implemented as new features get developed
└── libraries           // shared test keywords (functions) across various test suites
└── variables           // shared variables across various test suites
```

## Setting up a test environment

An easy way to bring up VOLTHA + BBSim for testing is by using
[kind-voltha](https://github.com/ciena/kind-voltha).  To set
up a minimal environment, first install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
and [the Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install).
Then run the following commands:

Note: Please make sure you are able to run the docker command, you can run as root or add your running user into docker group.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciena/kind-voltha
cd kind-voltha
EXTRA_HELM_FLAGS="--set defaults.image_tag=master" TYPE=minimal WITH_RADIUS=y WITH_BBSIM=y INSTALL_ONOS_APPS=y CONFIG_SADIS=y ./voltha up
source minimal-env.sh
```

The `defaults.image_tag` value above is used to specify which VOLTHA
branch images to pull from Docker Hub.
See all available versions in [Docker voltha](https://hub.docker.com/u/voltha/).

## Running the sanity tests

Assuming that you have brought up VOLTHA as described above,
to run the the sanity tests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opencord/voltha-system-tests
make -C voltha-system-tests sanity-kind
```

This test execution will generate three report files in
`voltha-system-tests/tests/sanity` (`output.xml`,
`report.html`, `log.html`). View the `report.html` page in a browser
to analyze the results.

## Test variables

The `make sanity-kind` target is equivalent to the following:
```
ROBOT_PORT_ARGS="-v ONOS_REST_PORT:8181 -v ONOS_SSH_PORT:8101" \
ROBOT_TEST_ARGS="--exclude notready --critical sanity" \
ROBOT_MISC_ARGS="-v num_onus:1" \
make sanity
```
If you are running the tests in another environment, you can run `make sanity`
with the arguments appropriate for your environment.  Look at
[variables.robot](variables/variables.robot) for a list of variables that
you may need to override.

# Running Tests on Physical POD

Assuming that a POD is available with all the required hardware and connections, we can
deploy the POD by following the procedure in this section below.

## Deploying POD

Deploying POD can be either be manual or automated using Jenkins job.

You can install it manually by following these steps below.

```
git clone https://github.com/ciena/kind-voltha.git
cd kind-voltha/
EXTRA_HELM_FLAGS='-f $WORKSPACE/${configBaseDir}/${configKubernetesDir}/voltha/${configFileName}.yml' WITH_RADIUS=y WITH_TP=yes DEPLOY_K8S=no INSTALL_KUBECTL=no INSTALL_HELM=no ONOS_TAG=voltha-2.1 ./voltha up
```
For more information on various environment variables with `./voltha up` please
check the link [here](https://github.com/ciena/kind-voltha/blob/master/README.md)

# Functional Testcases

All functional test cases are placed under `functional` folder.
`Voltha_PODTests.robot` consists of functional testcases that can be run on a physical POD.
Each robot testcase has a description in the `Documentation` section.
The same suite of tests can be run on any POD because parameters needed
for the test are written in .yaml file. Instead of hardcoding the POD specific
variables in the test case, tests rely on a separate configuration file which
describes the POD setup. This `.yaml` file contains details like the ONUs, OLT, nodes etc.
To create a configuration file for your POD, check this
[example](https://github.com/opencord/pod-configs/blob/master/deployment-configs/flex-ocp-cord.yaml)

Input data are stored in the `data` folder. Few examples of input data could be, test specific sadis configurations,
tech profiles etc. Please give appropriate file names to the input files.

To trigger tests on the physical POD
```
cd voltha-system-tests/tests/functional
robot -V <PATH_TO_YOUR_POD_CONFIGURATION_FILE> Voltha_PODTests.robot
```
Note: PATH_TO_YOUR_POD_CONFIGURATION_FILE should point to the yaml file that describes your POD setup.

Scenarios in each test suite can be associated with a `Tag`, using which a particular scenario can be
invoked during test execution.
As an example to execute only one testcase from the test suite you can do something like here
```
cd voltha-system-tests/tests/functional
robot -i test1 -V <PATH_TO_YOUR_POD_CONFIGURATION_FILE> Voltha_PODTests.robot
```
## Adding to the tests

Most additions should be done by adding keywords to the libraries, then
calling these keywords from the tests.  Consult a
[guide on how to write good Robot framework tests](https://github.com/robotframework/HowToWriteGoodTestCases/blob/master/HowToWriteGoodTestCases.rst).
When writing new functions, make sure there is proper documentation for it.  Also, follow a
good naming convention for any new functions.
There are also many keywords/functions available as part of the SEBA test framework which
can be found [here](https://github.com/opencord/cord-tester/tree/master/src/test/cord-api/Framework)

Tests should be written in RobotFramework as they need to be integrated with Jenkins test jobs.
Libraries can be written in python or RobotFramework.

Make sure that `make lint` passes, which runs
[robotframework-lint](https://github.com/boakley/robotframework-lint) on any
new code that is created.

## WIP:

*  Containerizing test environment so these tests can be run independent of the system.
